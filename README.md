# Earthquake Visualization 🌍
This map visualizes earthquake data from the past week, providing a dynamic and interactive way to explore seismic activity around the world. The goal is to make this data not only accessible but engaging for users by showcasing key attributes such as magnitude, location, and depth of earthquakes. With this map, you’ll be able to quickly see the severity of earthquakes and understand their geographic context.

## Features 🔑
- Interactive Map: Zoom in and out of the world map and toggle between different map styles (Street, Topography).
- Earthquake Data: Earthquakes are displayed as dynamic circle markers. The size of the circles corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color indicates the depth (from shallow green to deep red).
- Tectonic Plates Overlay: Visualize tectonic plate boundaries with an overlay.
- Popups: Each earthquake marker features a popup that shows important details, such as the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.

## Data Insights 📊
- Magnitude: The size of the earthquake's marker corresponds to the magnitude of the quake (larger = stronger).
- Depth: The color of the marker represents the depth of the earthquake, from shallow to deep. This gives a quick visual representation of how far underground the earthquake occurred. ⛏
- Tectonic Plates: With tectonic plates visible on the map, you can better understand the relation between seismic activity and plate boundaries.

## Legend 📉
A handy legend on the map explains how the colors correspond to earthquake depth ranges, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance. Just check out the box in the bottom right corner to get started. 🟩🟨🟧

## Why this project? 🤔
This project is part of my learning journey at edX Boot Camps, where I’m expanding my data analysis and visualization skills. I’m excited to share it with you, and I hope you find it as fascinating as I did building it! 😊
